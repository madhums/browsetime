Very much inspired by https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/how-i-developed-apples-screen-time-chrome-extension-988e0c451894, but tracks all domains and the time spent on them and gives you a nice list.

In order to install 

1. Download the extension [here](https://gitlab.com/madhums/screentime/-/archive/master/screentime-master.zip) and unzip it
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` or `brave://extensions/`
3. Enable developer mode on the top right corner
4. Click on "Load unpacked" button on the top left corner, this should ask you to browse for the files.
5. Point to the extracted files from step 1

Enjoy tracking how much time you spend on each website you visit!
